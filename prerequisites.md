# Prerequisites

There are hardware, software and service prerequisites for participating in this CodeJam.

## Hardware

Each participant must have their own laptop with enough admin privileges to be able to install software. You must also be able to access a command line shell (e.g. `cmd.exe` on Windows). The laptop must also be able to connect to the host organization's guest network for Internet access, and have enough power for the whole day.

## Software

Before the CodeJam day, participants must ensure they have the following installed on their laptops:

- Chrome (latest version) : [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Postman : [https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)

Participants should also install:

- Docker Desktop : [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (once installed, test out the installation by following the instructions [here for macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) or [here for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), ensuring that you can run the `docker` command line tool)

_Note: Docker Desktop is required to host a container where you will run an instance of the SAP Cloud Connector in one of the exercises. The installation of Docker Desktop is strongly recommended, because not having it means that you will not be able to complete that exercise. However, you can still continue the CodeJam as instructions will be provided describing the appropriate alternative configuration needed._

## Services

Each attendee must have the following already set up and enabled:

- an SAP Cloud Platform trial account. If you need to create a new account, go to [https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com), select the "Register" button and follow the instructions.

- an account on the SAP NetWeaver Gateway Demo system "ES5". [Sign up here](https://register.sapdevcenter.com/SUPSignForms/) and then ensure your account is active and the username and password are correct, by checking you can access HTTP-based services such as the [EPM_REF_APPS_SHOP_SRV](https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/EPM_REF_APPS_SHOP_SRV/?sap-client=002) OData service. If you need more help, you can follow the "[Create an Account on the Gateway Demo System](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/gateway-demo-signup.html)" tutorial.
