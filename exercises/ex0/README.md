# Getting Started

In this exercise, you will connect to the system and create your package. Be sure to use your assigned group number anywhere you see XXX in this document. 

## System Access & Package Creation

After completing these steps you will have accessed your trial account on SAP Business Technology Platform, created a service instance for the ABAP Trial on BTP, created a connection to the system from ABAP Development Tools in Eclipse, and finally created your group package which will be used for the rest of your exercise.

1.  Access the BTP, ABAP Environment Trial system by following the directions outlined in this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-trial-onboarding.html). Once complete, return to this document and continue with step 2.
